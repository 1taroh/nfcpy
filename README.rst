The **nfcpy** module implements `NFC Forum`_ specifications for
wireless short-range data exchange with NFC devices and tags. It is
written in `Python`_ and aims to provide an easy-to-use yet powerful
framework for applications. The source code is licensed under the
`EUPL`_ and hosted at `GitHub`_. Release versions are published at
`PyPI`_ for easy installation with ``pip install -U nfcpy``.
Documentation for the latest development and active release
versions can be found on `Read the Docs`_.

.. note:: The development home for **nfcpy** (until release 0.11) used
   to be `Launchpad`_ which will continue to be monitored for
   questions until it is possible to create an *nfcpy* tag on `Stack
   Overflow`_ (requires more reputation points but maybe someone wants
   to help out).
