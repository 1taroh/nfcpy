The **nfcpy** module implements `NFC Forum`_ specifications for
wireless short-range data exchange with NFC devices and tags. It is
written in `Python`_ and aims to provide an easy-to-use yet powerful
framework for applications integrating NFC. The source code is
licensed under the `EUPL`_ and hosted at `GitHub`_. Release versions
are published on `PyPI`_ for easy installation with ``pip install -U
nfcpy``. Documentation for the latest development and any active
release versions can be found on `Read the Docs`_. The old development
home at `Launchpad`_ can still be used for questions but the target
would be to use `Stack Overflow`_ (just missing an ``nfcpy`` tag and
can't create one yet).
