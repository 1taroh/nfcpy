Welcome to nfcpy's documentation!
=================================

The *nfcpy* module implements NFC Forum specifications for wireless short-range data exchange with NFC devices and tags. It is completely written in Python and aims to provide an easy to use, intuitive application programming interface. 

.. NFC is a short-range wireless technology, operating only within a few centimeters. If two NFC-enabled devices are brought close together, literally touched, NFC allows for context sensitive actions; a digital photo camera may automatically transfer the current image to a photo frame without further user interaction. NFC tags can be used to store data such as a Wi-Fi network configuration for provisioning new wireless clients or to 'tag' physical objects. Tags do not require batteries as power comes wireless from the reader.
